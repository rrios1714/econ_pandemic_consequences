    "Our Group's Project Proposal Background and Prior Work: \n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, the consequences of pandemic aren't just significantly lower the living and working conditions of residents but also affect the crime rate in the whole country. Living in San Diego, California, our group members have witnessed continuous alerts on our school district about potential or suspicious behaviors including burlary, robbery, anonymous threats, harrassment and more on our campus or neighbor areas, specifically some of us observed scary individuals appear at the Blue Line station multiple times. Hence, we are curious on whether there is a potential connection between those concerned actions and changes in our educational policy recently because there must be some reasons that reveal the growth of unlawful behaviors in the local area versus the recent modifications in academic regulations. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Public Policy Institute of California, the study reports gather datas from four cities in California including Log Angeles, Oakland, San Francisco and San Diego to indicate the rising in violent crime rates in 2021, and in the scope of San Diego, the violent crimes increased by 8.1%, \"the property crime increase was 6.1%\", nobtably \"Vehicle theft also rose by 10%\" (Meyer)[1], obviously, we found some evidence on the pandemic crime trends, our investigation aims to clarify whether education plays a role in the article outcomes, understanding these can lead to potential contributions on mitigating those issues in the upcoming years.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the  Center for Public Integrity, there are disparities that occur in certain groups of student that represent unequal treatment across several campuses. In particular, \"at the San Diego Unified School District, Black students comprised about 8% of enrollment but made up nearly 19% of referrals. Students with disabilities made up more than 30% of referrals but only 14% of the population\" (Bowman)[2], it illustrates the important irregularity that impact these group of students in their way of receiving education. This could be a reason for the inclusion of students in the broader crime rates in San Diego, and some school system may be the factor and need to be reconsider to provide fair study environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another additional information is collected from 2003 to 2018 in the article \"Education and Crime across America: Inequity’s Cost\" provides us the insight of the correlation between education spending and student safety. One of the conclusions after examination is the more investment putting of education, mentioned in the article, extra 1000$ difference is associated with 3% decrease in violent crimes, but 10% increase in property crime.[3] Hence, the cost of school is also one of the educational policies that make a visible connection to the changes to certain crime probabilities. Learning from this analysis in the early 21s years, there appears to be a potential in correlation educational policies towards unlawful behavior frequency in San Diego, moreover, it possibly continue to be the effect on later 2020 to 2022. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, one of the statistics we found could be utilized is the numeric data of changes in different type of crimes from 2019 to by The City of San Diego Police Department, the violent crimes went from 5,215 in 2019, to 5,303 in 2020 and 5,875 in 2021 which made up 10.8% increase from 2020 to 2021 which is relatively high that provokes attention from all possible aspects, and our group will focus on educational policies.[4]\n",

    "We predict that recent violent crimes rate in San Diego, in particular from 2020 to 2022, is influenced by the relevant modifications of academic policies of local school districts. We expect that some information we found such as inequity, school costs are parts of the frequency of violent crimes appear in San Diego, California. We think the public safety should be prioritized to successfully receive adequate and comfortable study in school. So we expect that as inequity is mitigated, school costs are fairly distributed, violent crimes decrease accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another observation that further supports this hypothesis is the crime rate in the city of Danville. According to the site PropertyHub, Danville is the top safest town in the state of California. The average crime rate for Danville is of 78% yearly, a significant difference to California's average crime rate rising up to 392% reaching the national average. When looking at the percentage of the population who pursued higher education 32.8% of the population has a Bachelor's or higher degree according to the U.S. Census completed in 2022. \n"

    "Our ideal dataset would consist of large datasets from across California regarding crime rates, separated into regions or counties. When analyzing the educational status of people in such regions, we will reference search for a database with numbers of what level of education has been completed the most in the region. We hope that we find datasets that are quantative with the number of people pursuing certain educational degrees and the number of crimes commited.

Although we are aware of these biases, we are aware that they may run into multiple biases when searching for these datasets. Some strageties we hope to use to navigate this is to find data from neutral organizations and do some research into the biases we are already expecting. The research we do will focus on applying unbiased analysis throughout our inquiry and what unbiased data collection looks like. If adjustments must be made to any component of our project to ensure the reduction of bias, we will do so accordingly. In addition, we would also seek either Professorr Jason, TA's, and/or IA's about our process to receive feedback if at any point we have must re-examine our strageties. \n",
    "\n",
    " We are also aware of some privacy concerns, specifically how to ensure that all our data is as anonymized as possible. This is very important when analyzing incident report data detailing identifiable data anyone involved in the incident. To address this, we will collect databases and assess the level of privacy disclosed. If the level is alarming, we will simply not work with that dataset to ensure we protect the privacy of those whose information was collected. We did discuss possibly applying de-identifying procedures but we would use that only if we are absolutely struggling to find datasets to answer our question.\n",
